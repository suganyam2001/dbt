models:
  - name: sug_correlation_metrics
    description: |
      Calculates correlations between state-level median rent and various
      quality of life and income metrics using refined data models.

      **How median rent is calculated:**
      - The median rent is computed for each state from the `refined_housing_data` model.
      - It uses the `PRICE` field and aggregates it by state.

      **Note:**
      - Some QOL metrics (Affordability, Economy, Education/Health, Safety) have been reversed
        (multiplied by -1) to ensure that higher scores consistently indicate better conditions.
      

      This model includes:
        - Income-Rent correlation
        - Affordability-Rent correlation (Reversed)
        - Economy-Rent correlation (Reversed)
        - Education and Health-Rent correlation (Reversed)
        - Safety-Rent correlation (Reversed)

    columns:
      - name: metric
        description: |
          The specific metric pair for correlation (e.g., Income-Rent, Affordability-Rent).
          Note: "Reversed" suffix indicates metrics that have been multiplied by -1
          for interpretability.
        tests:
          - not_null

      - name: correlation
        description: "The computed correlation coefficient between the median rent and the selected metric."
        tests:
          - not_null
